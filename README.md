# C3Projects--LMSmithTFY

## Project Goals:
* Create a deliverable web application that provides relevant Smiths songs based on search queries.
* Delight the miserable, morbid, and/or pale.

## Target Audience:
Smiths fans everywhere.

## Personal Learning Goals:
* Follow TDD for Rails portions of the project
* Consume an API to play audio
* Use JavaScript for display logic
* Visual appeal, polished look and feel
* Use csv to seed (I haven't done this in prior projects)
* Awesome things happen when results are returned

## Technologies/frameworks/patterns
* Ruby on Rails, MVC pattern
* TDD for Rails portions
* Frontend: JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, HTML
* Rspec for testing
* Database: SQLite 3

## Tech and/or skill dependencies - I'm not sure what this means... What (else?) should go here?
* API: Rdio or Spotify?

## End Game
### Done:
* Seeded Smiths lyrics
* Main page in which search query is entered
* Returns and plays a song by The Smiths based on search query
* 95% test coverage for Rails portions

### Extra Fun:
* Suggest hilarious possible search terms by using JavaScript animations (I think) to change the placeholder value of the form text box.
* Randomized, Smiths-related visuals display along with search results
* "Feeling Smithy" or perhaps "Feeling Miserable" option that gives random result.
* Deploy to Heroku
