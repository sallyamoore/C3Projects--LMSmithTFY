Reel Around The Fountain;It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old you made him old Reel around the fountain slap me on the patio I'll take it now Fifteen minutes with you well I wouldn't say no oh people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong! Fifteen minutes with you I wouldn't say no oh people said that you were easily led and they were half right It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old you made him old Reel around the fountain slap me on the patio I'll take it now Fifteen minutes with you I wouldn't say no oh people see no worth in you oh but I do Fifteen minutes with youoh I wouldn't say no oh people see no worth in you but I do I dreamt about you last night and I fell out of bed twice you can pin and mount me like a butterfly But take me to the haven of your bed was something that you never said two lumps please you're the bee's knees but so am I Meet me at the fountain shove me on the patio I'll take it slowly Fifteen minutes with you oh I wouldn't say no people see no worth in you oh but I do
You've Got Everything Now;As merry as the days were long I am right and you were long back at the old grey school I would win and you would lose But you've got everything now you've got everything now and what a terrible mess I've made of my life oh what a mess I've made of my life No I've never had a job because I've never wanted one I've seen you smile but I've never really heard you laugh so who is rich and who is poor? I cannot say You are your Mother's only son and you're a desperate one but I don't want a lover I just want to be seen in the back of your car A friendship sadly lost? well this is true and yet it's false but did I ever tell you by the way I never did like your face But you've got everything now you've got everything now and what a terrible mess I've made of my life oh what a mess I've made of my life No I've never had a job because I'm too shy I've seen you smile but I've never really heard you laugh so who is rich and who is poor? I cannot say You are your Mother's only son and you're a desperate one but I don't want a lover I just want to be tied to the back of your car to the back of your car to the back of your car to the back of your car
Miserable Lie;So goodbye Please stay with your own kind And I'll stay with mine There's something against us It's not time It's not time So goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye I know I need hardly say How much I love your casual way Oh but please put your tongue away A little higher and we're well away The dark nights are drawing in And your humour is as black as them I look at yours you laugh at mine And love is just a miserable lie You have destroyed my flower-like life Not once - twice You have corrupt my innocent mind Not once - twice I know the wind-swept mystical air It means: I'd like to see your underwear I recognise that mystical air It means: I'd like to seize your underwear What do we get for our trouble and pain? Just a rented room in Whalley Range What do we get for our trouble and pain? Whalley Range! Into the depths of the criminal world I followed her I need advice I need advice I need advice I need advice Nobody ever looks at me twice Nobody ever looks at me twice I'm just a country-mile behind The world I'm just a country-mile behind The whole world Oh oh oh I'm just a country-mile behind The world I'm just a country-mile behind The whole world Oh oh oh Take me when you go Oh oh oh Take me when you go Oh oh oh I need advice I need advice
Pretty Girls Make Graves;Upon the sand upon the bay There is a quick and easy way you say Before you illustrate I'd rather state I'm not the man you think I am I'm not the man you think I am And Sorrow's native son He will not smile for anyone And Pretty Girls Make Graves Oh End of the pier end of the bay You tug my arm and say: Give in to lust Give up to lust oh heaven knows we'll Soon be dust Oh I'm not the man you think I am I'm not the man you think I am And Sorrow's native son He will not rise for anyone And Pretty Girls Make Graves Oh really? Oh I could have been wild and I could have Been free But Nature played this trick on me She wants it Now And she will not wait But she's too rough And I'm too delicate Then on the sand Another man he takes her hand A smile lights up her stupid face (and well it would) I lost my faith in Womanhood I lost my faith in Womanhood I lost my faith Oh Hand in glove The sun shines out of our behinds Oh
The Hand That Rocks The Cradle;Please don't cry For the ghost and the storm outside Will not invade this sacred shrine Nor infiltrate your mind My life down I shall lie If the bogey-man should try To play tricks on your sacred mind To tease torment and tantalise Wavering shadows loom A piano plays in an empty room There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight And when darknesss lifts and the room is bright I'll still be by your side For you are all that matters And I'll love you to till the day I die There never need be longing in your eyes As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine Ceiling shadows shimmy by And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey There's sadness in your beautiful eyes Oh your untouched unsoiled wonderous eyes My life down I shall lie Should restless spirits try To play tricks on your sacred mind I once had a child and it saved my life And I never even asked his name I just looked into his wondrous eyes And said: never never never again And all too soon I did return Just like a moth to a flame So rattle my bones all over the stones I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns Oh see how words as old as sin Fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay Together we lie together we pray There never need be longing in your eyes As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine Mine Climb up on my knee sonny boy Although you're only three sonny boy You're - you're mine And your mother she just never knew Oh your mother As long as long as long I did my best for her I did my best for her As long as long as long as as long I did my best for her I did my best for her Oh
This Charming Man;Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate will Nature make a man of me yet?

Cemetry Gates;A dreaded sunny day So I meet you at the cemetery gates Keats and Yeats are on your side A dreaded sunny day So I meet you at the cemetery gates Keats and Yeats are on your side While Wilde is on mine So we go inside and we gravely read the stones All those people all those lives Where are they now? With the loves and hates And passions just like mine They were born And then they lived and then they died Seems so unfair And I want to cry You say: ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn And you claim these words as your own But I've read well and I've heard them said A hundred times maybe less maybe more If you must write prose and poems The words you use should be your own Don't plagiarise or take on loans There's always someone somewhere With a big nose who knows And who trips you up and laughs When you fall Who'll trip you up and laugh When you fall You say: ere long done do does did Words which could only be your own And then you then produce the text From whence was ripped some dizzy whore 1804 A dreaded sunny day So let's go where we're happy And I meet you at the cemetery gates Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side A dreaded sunny day So let's go where we're wanted And I meet you at the cemetery gates Keats and Yeats are on your side But you lose because Wilde is on mine
