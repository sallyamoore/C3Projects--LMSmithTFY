Reel Around The Fountain, It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old you made him old Reel around the fountain slap me on the patio I'll take it now Fifteen minutes with you well I wouldn't say no oh people said that you were virtually dead and they were so wrong! Fifteen minutes with you I wouldn't say no oh people said that you were easily led and they were half right It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old you made him old Reel around the fountain slap me on the patio I'll take it now Fifteen minutes with you I wouldn't say no oh people see no worth in you oh but I do Fifteen minutes with youoh I wouldn't say no oh people see no worth in you but I do I dreamt about you last night and I fell out of bed twice you can pin and mount me like a butterfly But take me to the haven of your bed was something that you never said two lumps please you're the bee's knees but so am I Meet me at the fountain shove me on the patio I'll take it slowly Fifteen minutes with you oh I wouldn't say no people see no worth in you oh but I do
You've Got Everything Now, As merry as the days were long I am right and you were long back at the old grey school I would win and you would lose But you've got everything now you've got everything now and what a terrible mess I've made of my life oh what a mess I've made of my life No I've never had a job because I've never wanted one I've seen you smile but I've never really heard you laugh so who is rich and who is poor? I cannot say You are your Mother's only son and you're a desperate one but I don't want a lover I just want to be seen in the back of your car A friendship sadly lost? well this is true and yet it's false but did I ever tell you by the way I never did like your face But you've got everything now you've got everything now and what a terrible mess I've made of my life oh what a mess I've made of my life No I've never had a job because I'm too shy I've seen you smile but I've never really heard you laugh so who is rich and who is poor? I cannot say You are your Mother's only son and you're a desperate one but I don't want a lover I just want to be tied to the back of your car to the back of your car to the back of your car to the back of your car
Miserable Lie, So goodbye Please stay with your own kind And I'll stay with mine There's something against us It's not time It's not time So goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye I know I need hardly say How much I love your casual way Oh but please put your tongue away A little higher and we're well away The dark nights are drawing in And your humour is as black as them I look at yours you laugh at mine And love is just a miserable lie You have destroyed my flower-like life Not once - twice You have corrupt my innocent mind Not once - twice I know the wind-swept mystical air It means: I'd like to see your underwear I recognise that mystical air It means: I'd like to seize your underwear What do we get for our trouble and pain? Just a rented room in Whalley Range What do we get for our trouble and pain? Whalley Range! Into the depths of the criminal world I followed her I need advice I need advice I need advice I need advice Nobody ever looks at me twice Nobody ever looks at me twice I'm just a country-mile behind The world I'm just a country-mile behind The whole world Oh oh oh I'm just a country-mile behind The world I'm just a country-mile behind The whole world Oh oh oh Take me when you go Oh oh oh Take me when you go Oh oh oh I need advice I need advice
Pretty Girls Make Graves, Upon the sand upon the bay There is a quick and easy way you say Before you illustrate I'd rather state I'm not the man you think I am I'm not the man you think I am And Sorrow's native son He will not smile for anyone And Pretty Girls Make Graves Oh End of the pier end of the bay You tug my arm and say: Give in to lust Give up to lust oh heaven knows we'll Soon be dust Oh I'm not the man you think I am I'm not the man you think I am And Sorrow's native son He will not rise for anyone And Pretty Girls Make Graves Oh really? Oh I could have been wild and I could have Been free But Nature played this trick on me She wants it Now And she will not wait But she's too rough And I'm too delicate Then on the sand Another man he takes her hand A smile lights up her stupid face (and well it would) I lost my faith in Womanhood I lost my faith in Womanhood I lost my faith Oh Hand in glove The sun shines out of our behinds Oh
The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Please don't cry For the ghost and the storm outside Will not invade this sacred shrine Nor infiltrate your mind My life down I shall lie If the bogey-man should try To play tricks on your sacred mind To tease torment and tantalise Wavering shadows loom A piano plays in an empty room There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight And when darknesss lifts and the room is bright I'll still be by your side For you are all that matters And I'll love you to till the day I die There never need be longing in your eyes As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine Ceiling shadows shimmy by And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey There's sadness in your beautiful eyes Oh your untouched unsoiled wonderous eyes My life down I shall lie Should restless spirits try To play tricks on your sacred mind I once had a child and it saved my life And I never even asked his name I just looked into his wondrous eyes And said: never never never again And all too soon I did return Just like a moth to a flame So rattle my bones all over the stones I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns Oh see how words as old as sin Fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay Together we lie together we pray There never need be longing in your eyes As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine Mine Climb up on my knee sonny boy Although you're only three sonny boy You're - you're mine And your mother she just never knew Oh your mother As long as long as long I did my best for her I did my best for her As long as long as long as as long I did my best for her I did my best for her Oh
This Charming Man, Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate will Nature make a man of me yet? When in this charming car this charming man Why pamper life's complexities when the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat? I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear this man said It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care A jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place he said return the rings he knows so much about these things he knows so much about these things I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear this man said It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care This charming man this charming man A jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place he said return the ring he knows so much about these things he knows so much about these things he knows so much about these things
Still Ill, I decree today that life is simply taking and not giving England is mine and it owes me a living ask me why and I'll spit in your eye ask me why and I'll spit in your eye But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore no we cannot cling to those dreams Does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body? I dunno Under the iron bridge we kissed and although I ended up with sore lips it just wasn't like the old days anymore no it wasn't like those days am I still ill? am I still ill? Does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body? I dunno Ask me why and I'll die oh ask me why and I'll die and if you must go to work tomorrow well if I were you I wouldn't bother for there are brighter sides to life and I should know because I've seen them but not very often Under the iron bridge we kissed and although I ended up with sore lips it just wasn't like the old days anymore no it wasn't like those days am I still ill? am I still ill?
Hand In Glove, Hand in glove the sun shines out of our behinds No it's NOT like any other love this one's different because it's us!

I Want The One I Can't Have, On the day that your mentality catches up with your biology I want the one I can't have and it's driving me mad it's written all over my face On the day that your mentality catches up with your biology I want the one I can't have and it's driving me mad it's written all over my face A double-bed and a stalwart lover for sure these are the riches of the poor A double-bed and a stalwart lover for sure these are the riches of the poor A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails raised on Prisoner's Aid he killed a policeman when he was thirteen and someone that really impressed me it's written all over my face On the day that your mentality catches up with your biology And if you ever need self-validation just meet me in the alley by the railway-station it's written all over my face
What She Said, What she said: How come someone hasn't noticed that I'm dead and decided to bury me God knows I'm ready What she said was sad but then all the rejections she's had to pretend to be happy could only be idiocy What she said was not for the job or lover that she never had What she read all heady books she'd sit and prophesise (it took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead to really really open her eyes) What she said: I smoke 'cos I'm hoping for an early death AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !

Nowhere Fast, I'd like to drop my trousers to the world I am a man of means (of slender means) each household appliance is like a new science in my town and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean and when a train goes by it's such a sad sound I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen every sensible child will know what this means the poor and the needy are selfish and greedy on her terms and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean and when a train goes by it's such a sad sound And when I'm lying in my bed I think about life and I think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie in the middle of the street and die I'd lie down and die

The Queen Is Dead, Farewell to this land's cheerless marches Hemmed in like a boar between arches Her very Lowness with her head in a sling I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing I say Charles don't you ever crave To appear on the front of the Daily Mail Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil? And so I checked all the registered historical facts And I was shocked into shame to discover How I'm the 18th pale descendent Of some old queen or other Oh has the world changed or have I changed? Oh has the world changed or have I changed? Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs I swear to God I swear I never even knew what drugs were So I broke into the Palace With a sponge and a rusty spanner She said: Eh I know you and you cannot sing I said: that's nothing - you should hear me play piano We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry And talk about precious things But when you are tied to your mother's apron No-one talks about castration We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry And talk about precious things Like love and law and poverty These are the things that kill me We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry And talk about precious things But the rain that flattens my hair These are the things that kill me Passed the pub that saps your body And the church who'll snatch your money The Queen is dead boys And it's so lonely on a limb Pass the pub that wrecks your body And the church all they want is your money The Queen is dead boys And it's so lonely on a limb Life is very long when you're lonely Life is very long when you're lonely Life is very long when you're lonely Life is very long when you're lonely

Never Had No One Ever, When you walk without ease On these streets where you were raised I had a really bad dream It lasted 20 years 7 months and 27 days And I know that I know that I never had no one ever Now I'm outside your house I'm alone And I'm outside your house I hate to intrude I know I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone And I never never had no one ever I never had no one ever
Cemetry Gates, A dreaded sunny day So I meet you at the cemetery gates Keats and Yeats are on your side A dreaded sunny day So I meet you at the cemetery gates Keats and Yeats are on your side While Wilde is on mine So we go inside and we gravely read the stones All those people all those lives Where are they now? With the loves and hates And passions just like mine They were born And then they lived and then they died Seems so unfair And I want to cry You say: ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn And you claim these words as your own But I've read well and I've heard them said A hundred times maybe less maybe more If you must write prose and poems The words you use should be your own Don't plagiarise or take on loans There's always someone somewhere With a big nose who knows And who trips you up and laughs When you fall Who'll trip you up and laugh When you fall You say: ere long done do does did Words which could only be your own And then you then produce the text From whence was ripped some dizzy whore 1804 A dreaded sunny day So let's go where we're happy And I meet you at the cemetery gates Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side A dreaded sunny day So let's go where we're wanted And I meet you at the cemetery gates Keats and Yeats are on your side But you lose because Wilde is on mine
Bigmouth Strikes Again, Sweetness sweetness I was only joking When I said I'd like to Smash every tooth in your head Sweetness sweetness I was only joking When I said by rights you should be Bludgeoned in your bed And now I know how Joan of Arc felt Now I know how Joan of Arc felt As the flames rose to her Roman nose And her Walkman started to melt Bigmouth bigmouth Bigmouth strikes again And I've got no right to take my place With the human race And now I know how Joan of Arc felt Now I know of Joan of Arc felt As the flames rose to her Roman nose And her hearing aid started to melt Bigmouth bigmouth Bigmouth strikes again And I've got no right to take my place With the human race 
The Boy With The Thorn In His Side, The boy with the thorn in his side Behind the hatred there lies A murderous desire for love How can they look into my eyes And still they don't believe me How can they hear me say those words And still they don't believe me And if they don't believe me now Will they ever believe me? And if they don't believe me now Will they ever believe me? The boy with the thorn in his side Behind the hatred there lies A plundering desire for love How can they see the love in our eyes And still they don't believe us And after all this time They don't want to believe us And if they don't believe us now Will they ever believe us? And when you want to live How do you start? Where do you go? Who do you know?
